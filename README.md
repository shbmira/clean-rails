# clean-rails
Example of Clean Architectured applied to Ruby On Rails

## Rails 5
[Clean Architecture](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) is something very new (I think so). So this example utilizes **Rails 5** with **Ruby 2.4.1** (I'm not going to update this because it's initial information about my idea; Any version changes will be controlled by appropriate tools.).
There is and will be some errors and misconceptions about the theory, but you can collaborate! :)
